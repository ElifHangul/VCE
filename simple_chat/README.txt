NOTE: When doing this project, I worked with my friend Hamit Kavas. Both of us missing some classes because of overlapping and decided to help each other. 
He was especially helpful about the css. But his code gave errors on javascript and we could not solve them on time. 
However, I wanted to remark that he worked really hard and assisted on my project.

- In the next steps 
=> I wanted to show currently open rooms so that the user could select which one to join or open a new one.
=> Add an avatar image selection panel
=> Show the room's occupants
=> Add emaji buttons at the left side of the input text field. But couldn't find time, so it is left blank.
=> Add time stamp for each text.
=> Send indiviual texts.
